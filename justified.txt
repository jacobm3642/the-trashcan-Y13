I have added the bootstrap in order to make my website responsive so that it works on a wide range of devices also added a colour 
changing button because both Jamie Felix and Daniel have all stated that the black white and grey colour scheme of my original 
website was quote “bland and uninteresting”  Jamie said that "my web site lacked colour and that  it was bland"  Felix said that "I 
should make my website more like his with his bold colour choices" vs my  the bland simplistic colour choices  Daniel  stated that
"My website lacked colour  in that it wasn't very eye catching." I have used specific fonts and text sizes in order to make it easier 
for people who may be can't see that well to be able to read my website considering I am one of those people who can't see that 
well. As well as there were no copyright privacy or other implications that applied to the specific website.
